        <h1>Learn More about Phishing Attacks</h1>
        <p>Phishing attacks are fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. Here are some common phishing attacks and tips to avoid them:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Email Phishing</h2>
        <p>Email phishing involves sending deceptive emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as banks or social media platforms. These emails often contain links to fake websites or malicious attachments.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Always verify the sender's email address, check for spelling and grammar errors, and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Spear Phishing</h2>
        <p>Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers customize their messages for specific individuals or organizations. These emails often contain personalized information to make them appear more legitimate.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Be cautious of emails requesting sensitive information or urgent action, even if they seem to come from known contacts. Always confirm the authenticity of requests through alternative channels.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Vishing</h2>
        <p>Vishing, or voice phishing, involves phone calls from scammers pretending to be from legitimate organizations, such as banks or government agencies. They often use social engineering techniques to manipulate victims into revealing sensitive information over the phone.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Be wary of unsolicited calls requesting personal or financial information. Never provide sensitive information over the phone unless you initiated the call and are certain of the recipient's identity.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Smishing</h2>
        <p>Smishing is a form of phishing that occurs through SMS (text messages) or other messaging apps. Attackers send deceptive messages containing links to fake websites or malicious software.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Avoid clicking on links or responding to messages from unknown senders. Be cautious of messages requesting immediate action or offering unexpected rewards or prizes.</p>
